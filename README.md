# JMB Printing Services - Website

This project is a website for **JMB Printing Services - Professional Printing Solutions**.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `index.html` → Original version (with inline CSS & JS).  
- `index_linked.html` → Updated version that links to `styles.css` and `scripts.js`.  
- `styles.css` → Contains all CSS styles extracted from the original HTML.  
- `scripts.js` → Contains all JavaScript extracted from the original HTML.  
- `README.md` → Project documentation (this file).  

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open `index.html`**  
   - This version has inline CSS and JavaScript (exactly as in the original file).  

2. **Open `index_linked.html`**  
   - This version uses external CSS (`styles.css`) and JavaScript (`scripts.js`) for easier editing and cleaner structure.  

3. Make sure all files are in the same folder for the linked version to work properly.  

## 🌐 Hosting

You can host this website on any static hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).  

- Use `index.html` if you prefer a **single-file version**.  
- Use `index_linked.html` if you prefer **modular files** that are easier to maintain.  

## 📝 Notes
